FIFA 19 is a football simulation video game developed by EA Vancouver as part of Electronic Artsâ€™ FIFA series. As a football fan and game player, I wrote this blog post to perform some data exploration on FIFA 19 Player Dataset from Kaggle.

The dataset contains information of all 18207 players from the latest edition FIFA 19. There are 89 attributes including personal information like age, name, nationality, photo, club, wage, etc, and also player skill information like ball control, dribbling, crossing, finishing, GK skills and etc.
